# Fatal Force: Institutional Discrimination in U.S. Law Enforcement

## Overview  
This project analyzes institutional discrimination in U.S. law enforcement by exploring patterns of deadly force incidents using **data science techniques**. The dataset captures **police-involved fatal shootings** across the U.S., allowing us to identify **racial disparities, mental health considerations, and key risk factors**.

Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, we performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, followed by **machine learning modeling** with **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees** to predict patterns of deadly force incidents.

## Objectives  
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and ensure integrity for modeling.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify racial disparities, dangerous states/cities, weapon involvement, and the role of mental illness in police shootings.  
✔ **Predictive Modeling:** Use ML classifiers to predict police use of deadly force based on various attributes.  
✔ **Model Evaluation:** Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of classification models.
